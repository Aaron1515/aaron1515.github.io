      <h2>Where am I from?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        I was bored in China and came to America when I was only two years old. I know little to nothing from where I’m from. I call California my home now. I do have a dual citizenship which is great. If I ever were to travel back to China I can stay as long as I like. However it would be hard for me to coup in a country that I am so foreign to.  Maybe one day I can go back to and experience what life will be like if I didn’t leave.  Leaving to America was a dream that my parents wanted for my sister and I hoping to escape the poverty life and build a new future. At the time America was a place of dream of a good life and anyone that comes here has a change to achieve their dreams and be able to provide a better life.

        After arriving to the states our family found our first home in beautiful city of San Francisco. San Francisco has the most diversity in the whole in my opinion. San Francisco has Chinatown, Russian Hill, Japantown, Castro District, Mission District and many more that I can’t name them all. It was a city of acceptance of all race and ethnic backgrounds. At the time San Francisco was an affordable city to live in for all income levels.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Few years later our family worked hard and long hours and was finally able to buy a house. We decided to buy a house in Oakland, Ca where it is more affordable. Plus Oakland is the “up and coming” city. That’s where our family spent the last twenty five years. Oakland wasn’t as crowded as San Francisco and has all the same amenities but in a much smaller dosage. Houses are a bit spread apart, there’s not as much traffic however the crime rate is much higher. But we was willing to put up with that as long as we were home owners.

        In the last four years I finally moved out of my parent’s place and found a place of my own that I can call home. I’m current living in San Leandro, CA. It’s twenty minutes away from San Francisco and only a short drive in Oakland, CA to see my parents. San Leandro is much nicer and has a lot more space to free myself from everything. That’s my life story of moving around in the bay area and how I cam to America.</p>

      <h2>My interests/hobbies</h2>
      <br>
      <p><img class="bike" src="imgs/me-bike.jpg" alt="Aaron with bike">
        My main hobby is coding now. When I feel bored I start to code and have fun with it. I know its stressful at times trying to figure things out. But what hobby isn’t challenging at times.  I try to limit myself from staring at the screen for too long.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        My second hobby is riding my motorcycle. Being on a motorcycle make me feel free and all the trouble in the world floats away. All I can hear is the muffler rumbling behind me and blurs on the side peripherals.  It's as dangerous as people say it is but I enjoy it so much that the good out weights the bad.  I did has some close calls on the street, freeway, and every place in between.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        My third and final hobby at this time is going out to eat. I love food!!!! Yes, I am what you would call a foodie. My favorite is going out trying new place and new cuisine. This is why I’m also broke. Because I spent it on food. People love purse, shoes, cars. Mines is food.

      <h2>Educational Experiences</h2>
      <p>I don’t have much experience in coding but I have taken a HTML class 20 years ago. That is probably when HTML 0 existed. I worked as field tech and in-house doing: electric installs, cloning, data forensic, setting up business apps, business consulting, and command line virus eradication, VM in most environment. I been around computers for a long time.  My first machine was a IBM 386.  I started with MS-Dos, then windows 95, 98, Vista, and Windows 7.  I always been a huge PC fan and I was a big gamer fan.  I always build my own gaming rig when I started working.  Now that that I am developer I change my computer to a Mac.  It wasn't that hard to pickup since I alraedy have a iPod, iPad, iPhone, and an Apple Tv.  I'm all Mac-ed out.</p>

      <h2>Something quirky about me - The DBC tradition</h2>
      <p>
      I have to sleep with the TV on.  If you turn off the TV I’ll wake back up unless I’m in heavy sleep.  When I was younger I always had the music playing when I was sleeping or fall asleep watching TV.  So don’t turn the TV off on me or turn it on if you want me to fall asleep.
