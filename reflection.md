##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that you can really jump into a huge rabbit hole with this padding, borders, and margin thing.  If you want to get it just right.  You may want to tweak it till it looks 100%.

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?

CSS positioning can be very fun to work with and seeing how it moves on top, behind, to the sides.  Getting it where I really want things to show is pretty hard.  What I have drawn in my wireframe doesn't come out the way I have it.  Which can be frustration at time because there's so many different ways you can position things on the page.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The easiest way to implement was just make everything class instead of using id's.  You can go from parent to siblings within the same tree.

The most difficult part is targeting things in CSS for me.  I did a lot of trial and error before I got it right.  For example I want to target changes inside a nav>ul>li.  I was able to ask for help how to target things and did some research to find best practice on how to do it.

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

Few things I learned was don't spend too much time doing one thing and not pay attention to the rest of the page. I did notice that some of the things that wasn't done deliberately was done by html5. Such as the responsive web design.  How the nav bar moves down when the page gets too small.

CSS is a great way to add a lot of style to the page.  With CSS you can change the whole look of the page with just changing a few things in CSS without touching html file.  If a client doesn't like the background color you can change it and not have to look through html to change it and it will also change the rest of the site instead of just one html file.  I also learned that you can have multiply CSS files so getting the concept of having two or more CSS was a big confusing and I ran into a bit of a rough patch with that.  After I make a few modification I was able to correct it with the second CSS instead of the default.
