        <p>I wanted to share why I joined Devboot Camp with you.  I started to look for another career a year ago.  That is when one of my very good friend joined Dev.  It seems sketchy at the time and I didn’t have the finance backing me up to be able to attend school and not work and having so much expenses a the time.  I now that I have created a stable plan and have cut down on a lot of expense.  I am able to attend dev boot camp and not worry about money during the time I am here with all of you.  The main reason why I want to join is be able to create or be a part of a team that will be creating a future.<p>

            As a person that knows nothing about programing before starting DBC it is very fun.  I love the challenges the I come across.  The “ah” moments are always there.  I’m really glad I started this programming thing.  I’m sure I’ll be running into more of the “ah” moments.
