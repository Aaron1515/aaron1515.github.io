      Methods

      <p>
        Commonly used Methods and Enumerables.  These are my favorite ones to use.  They are the basic concept of programing.  You can do so much with so little.  All the methods I will list out will be what helped me through our Phase 0.  Having the understanding of just the little things could make a big impact on learning the break down large projects.

        <code>
          <----- Basic Methods ------->

          .include? (check if it include something)
          .length (to get the lenght of string, arrays)

          <----- Enumerable Methods ------->
          .map (collect and put in Array)
          .each  (collect only)
          .each_with_indes {|key, index|} (to obtain the key and index of something)
          .max (highest integer of something)

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

When we came together and split up the work, who will do the wireframe and who will do the translation from wireframe to html syntax.  We breeze through it pretty fast.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes, I found it extremely useful to create a wireframe first then create something from it and how where things are going to be located.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We split the work load, we put our ideas together and know what we wanted in a wireframe.  Since we split the work load, as long as it has my ideas and what I want it to have.  It would look un-natural because of the styling isn't on the page yet.  So therefor when the styling comes in to place.  It could be the same but have a totally different look and feel to it but the basic idea would be the same.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned a new semantic called "nav".  With nav is generally place on top of the screen for the naviagtion of the page.
