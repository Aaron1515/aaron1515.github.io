    <h2>
      Factoral - Using Recursion
    </h2>
    <br>
      <p>
        Here's a way to make a method to calculate a factoral number.  How it works is that there's a base case.  When it's counting down and return it when the count down is at 1.  The else line is where it keeps the highest number and run a recusion to get the numbers till it hits 1 on the count down and tally it up and multiply by the original number that was inserted.

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

When we came together and split up the work, who will do the wireframe and who will do the translation from wireframe to html syntax.  We breeze through it pretty fast.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes, I found it extremely useful to create a wireframe first then create something from it and how where things are going to be located.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We split the work load, we put our ideas together and know what we wanted in a wireframe.  Since we split the work load, as long as it has my ideas and what I want it to have.  It would look un-natural because of the styling isn't on the page yet.  So therefor when the styling comes in to place.  It could be the same but have a totally different look and feel to it but the basic idea would be the same.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned a new semantic called "nav".  With nav is generally place on top of the screen for the naviagtion of the page.
