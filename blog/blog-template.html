    <h2>Arrays</h2>
      <p>Arrays seems to be a simple list to most.  Arrays have a simple list of items with in it.  It could be a mix of number or even strings within an array.  Or even array inside an array.  Arrays are more complx then just a list.  Array could be used for so many things beside a list. I have seen arrays such as <code>point1=[23,23,23,23]</code> and <code>point2=[32, 32, 32, 32]</code> used with a program called Sketchup (a 3D program) to mark points on a 3D model.  After watching a few videos of how arrays are used they are more powerful then just a list.  It could be used within other programs to make points, keep data, collect data, and many more.</p>

<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

When we came together and split up the work, who will do the wireframe and who will do the translation from wireframe to html syntax.  We breeze through it pretty fast.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes, I found it extremely useful to create a wireframe first then create something from it and how where things are going to be located.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We split the work load, we put our ideas together and know what we wanted in a wireframe.  Since we split the work load, as long as it has my ideas and what I want it to have.  It would look un-natural because of the styling isn't on the page yet.  So therefor when the styling comes in to place.  It could be the same but have a totally different look and feel to it but the basic idea would be the same.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned a new semantic called "nav".  With nav is generally place on top of the screen for the naviagtion of the page.
