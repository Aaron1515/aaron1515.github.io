        Version control allow programmers to control what works and what doesn't and allow us to reverse and revise changes that has been made to coding.

        How does git help you keep track of changes?
          Git allow us to make changes in our staging area until we are finally happy with our changes before we commit to the change.  It also allow us to add comments on the change we are about to make.  It even allow us to have a time stamp of the change and who made the change.  When there's more than 1 person working on change its hard to compare who and when they did what.  Thank goodness there's git to shows all the records of it.

        Why use GitHub to store your code?
          Github is free.  It also allow us to have our codes on there to beable to share with fellow programers and keep some files private when we choose to keep it private.
